# Acuminator Release Notes
This document provides information about fixes, enhancements, and key features that are available in Acuminator.

## Acuminator 4.0.1: February 12, 2026
Acuminator 4.0.1 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions. This is a hotfix release that addresses issues discovered in Acuminator 4.0.0.

### New PX1039 Diagnostic
The new [PX1039](diagnostics/PX1039.md) diagnostic forbids the use of the `PX` namespace and its sub-namespaces for ISVs, OEMs, partners, and other external developers. These namespaces are reserved for use by Acumatica. The diagnostic is active only when the **ISV Mode** is enabled in Acuminator settings in Visual Studio options 
(`Tools -> Options -> Acuminator -> General -> Enable additional diagnostics for ISV Solution Certification`).

### Improvements in Existing Diagnostics
- The [PX1065](diagnostics/PX1065.md) diagnostic has been improved to reduce the amount of redundant alerts. The diagnostic reports missing BQL fields in DACs. Previously, it always displayed errors for a DAC extension or a derived DAC when its base DAC had a DAC field with a missing BQL field. For DAC extensions that customize DACs with multiple incorrect DAC fields, Acuminator displayed a lot of redundant alerts. After the improvement, the [PX1065](diagnostics/PX1065.md) diagnostic reports DAC fields from the base DAC only if they are customized by the DAC extension or overridden by the derived DAC.
- The algorithm that determines whether a DAC is fully unbound from the database has been enhanced with several heuristics. Now Acuminator determines whether a DAC is fully unbound according to the following rules:
  - A DAC with no DAC fields or with only unbound DAC fields is always considered fully unbound.
  - A DAC marked with `PX.Data.PXVirtualAttribute` is always considered fully unbound even if it has DB bound fields.
  - A DAC marked with `PX.Data.PXProjectionAttribute`, `PX.Data.PXAccumulatorAttribute` or any other attribute derived from `PX.Data.PXDBInterceptorAttribute` is always considered *DB bound* even if it has only unbound fields.
  - A DAC with a DB bound `NoteID` field is considered fully unbound if `NoteID` is the only DB bound field in the DAC and all other fields in the DAC are unbound.

  These changes reduced the amount of false alerts for the [PX1036](diagnostics/PX1036.md), [PX1069](diagnostics/PX1069.md), and [PX1110](diagnostics/PX1110.md) diagnostics. 
- The detection of view delegates in graphs and graph extensions has been fixed to correctly recognize view delegates in rare scenarios.
- The documentation for the [PX1079](diagnostics/PX1079.md), [PX1080](diagnostics/PX1080.md), and [PX1101](diagnostics/PX1101.md) diagnostics has been improved.


### Improvements in Acuminator Console Runner
- The new `--non-interactive` command-line flag has been added to Acuminator Console Runner. By default, Acuminator Console Runner supports interactive cancellation via `Ctrl + C` keyboard shortcut. The `--non-interactive` flag disables the interactive cancellation during the run. This allows Acuminator Console Runner to be used in non-interactive CI/CD environments such as Azure Pipelines.
- The issue with potential redistribution of MSBuild DLLs with the Acuminator Console Runner has been fixed. 

### Fixed Bugs
- The [PX1000](diagnostics/PX1000.md) diagnostic displayed false alert for `PXOverride` methods that override action delegates of graph actions.
- The [PX1023](diagnostics/PX1023.md) diagnostic displayed false alert for DAC fields with the `PX.Data.PXDBPackedIntegerArrayAttribute` attribute.
- The [PX1096](diagnostics/PX1096.md) diagnostic did not report `PXOverride` methods that were incompatible with their base methods only by return types, and the signatures of their delegate parameters were fully compatible with their base methods.
- The [PX1096](diagnostics/PX1096.md) diagnostic did not detect an incompatibility in the `ref`, `out`, `in`, and `ref readonly` parameters and return types between a `PXOverride` method and its base method.
- The [PX1096](diagnostics/PX1096.md) diagnostic displayed false alerts for `PXOverride` methods that override methods from the `PXGraph` type, such as the `Persist` method.
- The [PX1098](diagnostics/PX1098.md) diagnostic displayed false alert for `PXOverride` methods that override C# properties with a correct XML comment.
- The code fix for the [PX1098](diagnostics/PX1098.md) diagnostic did not correctly generate XML doc comment for the `PXOverride` methods that override C# properties.
- The code fix for the [PX1098](diagnostics/PX1098.md) diagnostic did not correctly handle the `PXOverride` methods with the `ref`, `out`, `in`, and `ref readonly` parameters.
- The code fixes for the [PX1079](diagnostics/PX1079.md) and [PX1101](diagnostics/PX1101.md) diagnostics did not correctly handle the `PXOverride` methods with the `ref`, `out`, `in`, and `ref readonly` parameters and/or
`ref` and `ref readonly` return types. After the bugfix, the diagnostics do no provide code fixes for such methods.
- The [PX1102](diagnostics/PX1102.md) diagnostic displayed false alerts for the `PXOverride` methods that override C# properties.

### Other Changes
- Acuminator dependencies have been updated.



## Acuminator 4.0.0: December 25, 2025
Acuminator 4.0.0 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Announcements

#### Support of Visual Studio 2017 Dropped
Starting from Acuminator 4.0.0, **Visual Studio 2017** is no longer supported. The last Acuminator version supporting Visual Studio 2017 is **Acuminator 3.1.3**.

#### Acuminator Supports ARM Platform
The Acuminator extension can now be used on machines with ARM64 processors, enabling development and code analysis on ARM-based devices. An example of such an environment is a MacBook with an ARM CPU that runs Windows and Visual Studio in a virtual machine. While this is not a commonly encountered working environment, you can now develop Acumatica code with Acuminator on these systems.

#### Analysis of `PXGraph.InstanceCreatedEvents.AddHandler` Calls Dropped
Analysis of calls to `PXGraph.InstanceCreatedEvents.AddHandler` calls has been dropped to significantly improve Acuminator's performance.

The `PXGraph.InstanceCreatedEvents.AddHandler` API adds event handlers to an Acumatica Framework event that is triggered when a new graph instance is created. Previously, the Acuminator analysis tried to check the correctness of such event handlers with [PX1054](diagnostics/PX1054.md), [PX1057](diagnostics/PX1057.md), [PX1058](diagnostics/PX1058.md), [PX1059](diagnostics/PX1059.md), [PX1081](diagnostics/PX1081.md), [PX1082](diagnostics/PX1082.md), and [PX1085](diagnostics/PX1085.md) diagnostics. 

The analysis of Acumatica source code has discovered that the `PXGraph.InstanceCreatedEvents.AddHandler` API is extremely rarely used. At the same time, the required Acuminator analysis for this feature involves expensive operations and is executed in many scenarios. Therefore, the analysis of `PXGraph.InstanceCreatedEvents.AddHandler` calls has been dropped and the performance of Acuminator has been improved as the result.

### New PX1099 Diagnostic
A new [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic has been introduced to Acuminator to flag the calls to APIs deemed as incompatible with the Acumatica Framework. Using these forbidden APIs can lead to unexpected behavior, application instability, data inconsistencies, and issues in the asynchronous code. Each forbidden API comes with its own specific reason to be banned from usage together with Acumatica Framework.

#### How PX1099 Reports API Calls 
The [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic validates all API calls in the code against a configurable **list of forbidden APIs**. The API call is reported if any of the following criteria is met:
- The API itself is in the list of forbidden APIs.
- The namespace containing the checked API is in the list of forbidden APIs.
- One of the types containing the API is in the list of forbidden APIs. In case of nested types, the API is banned if any of the containing types is in the list of banned APIs.
- The API is a type and one of its base types is in the list of banned APIs.
- The API is a method, property or event; also it is an override of a base type member, and one of the overridden members is in the list of banned APIs.

The [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic also supports a configurable **list of allowed APIs**. A call to the API from the allowed list is not reported by the diagnostic even if the API is recognized as forbidden according to the rules above. The combination of lists of forbidden and allowed APIs allows a flexible, granular and concise configuration of the PX1099 analysis.

#### PX1099 Diagnostic Settings
The [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic provides advanced configuration options that you can use to customize the diagnostic behavior. You can disable the diagnostic or configure custom files with forbidden and allowed APIs. You can find the PX1099 settings in the following Acuminator section of Visual Studio settings: `Tools -> Options -> Acuminator -> Banned API`:
![Banned API settings](diagnostics/images/BannedApiSettings.png)
The following settings are available:
- **Enable PX1099 diagnostic for banned APIs**: Enables or disables the [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic. By default, the diagnostic is enabled.
- **Banned APIs File**: Specifies the path to the file with forbidden APIs.
- **Allowed APIs File**: Specifies the path to the file with allowed APIs.

Acuminator comes with default lists of forbidden and allowed APIs. They are deployed by Acuminator as files on your machine in the `"My Documents Folder>\Acuminator\Acumatica Banned API"` folder. 
The **Banned APIs File** and **Allowed APIs File** settings are initially set to these files. You can modify these files to customize the list of banned and allowed APIs. The records in these files have the same API format. Each API record is represented by a single line in the file. You can find more about the format of API records from the diagnostic [documentation page](diagnostics/PX1099.md).

Note, that clearing the **Banned APIs File** and **Allowed APIs File** settings in Visual Studio will not disable the [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic. The diagnostic will use the default lists of forbidden and allowed APIs that are embedded into the Acuminator assemblies. To disable the [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic, you need to set the **Enable PX1099 diagnostic for banned APIs** setting to **false**.

#### APIs Banned by PX1099
The [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic comes with a default list of forbidden APIs. These APIs can be roughly divided into several groups:
- `System.Math.Round` overloads that do not specify the midpoint rounding mode.
- APIs to perform asynchronous and concurrent operations such as `System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel`, `System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Run`, `System.Threading.Tasks.Task.ConfigureAwait(bool)`.
- For ISVs and partner developers there are some additional groups of forbidden APIs:
  - The APIs used to obtain the information about the working environment, such as `System.Environment` and `System.OperatingSystem`.
  - The APIs used to access global web site parameters such as `PX.Common.WebConfig`.
  - Some of the **Reflection** APIs such as `System.Reflection.MethodInfo`.
  - Some IO APIs such as `System.Data.SqlClient` and `System.IO.File`.

The list of forbidden APIs may grow in the future. You can find the table with all APIs banned and allowed by the PX1099 diagnostic by default on the diagnostic [documentation page](diagnostics/PX1099.md).

### New Acuminator Diagnostics for DACs and DAC Extensions
- The new [PX1065](diagnostics/PX1065.md) diagnostic reports DAC field properties that are missing their corresponding BQL field declarations. An accompanying code fix is available to automatically generate the required BQL field, ensuring DAC integrity and preventing potential runtime errors.
- The new [PX1066](diagnostics/PX1066.md) diagnostic detects typos in names of DAC BQL fields. An accompanying code fix changes the name of the BQL field in the solution so that it matches the name of the DAC field property.
- The new [PX1067](diagnostics/PX1067.md) diagnostic reports BQL fields from derived DAC that are not redeclared. The code fix for this diagnostic adds redeclarations of all BQL fields declared in base DACs to the derived DAC.
- The new [PX1068](diagnostics/PX1068.md) diagnostic checks whether the type of the DAC field property matches the type of the BQL field. The diagnostic has two available code fixes:
  - Change the property type so that it corresponds to the type of the BQL field.
  - Change the type of the BQL field so that it corresponds to the property type.
- The new [PX1069](diagnostics/PX1069.md) diagnostic checks DACs for missing required fields such as audit fields and the `tstamp` field. An accompanying code fix can automatically add the missing mandatory fields to the DAC.
- The new [PX1078](diagnostics/PX1078.md) diagnostic checks for incompatible types and sizes between a local DAC field and a foreign DAC field referenced by the `PXSelector` attribute to prevent runtime truncation or mismatches. The diagnostic has been implemented by the member of the Acumatica Commerce team [Andrei Saiapin](https://github.com/acasj). His contribution is much appreciated.
- The new [PX1110](diagnostics/PX1110.md) diagnostic enforces that DACs with `PXDBLocalizableString` attributes also declare a `NoteID` field, preventing related runtime issues. An accompanying code fix adds the missing `NoteID` field to the DAC.
- The new [PX1117](diagnostics/PX1117.md) diagnostic detects DAC extensions with complex non-linear type hierarchies. Extending multiple independent DAC extensions is forbidden for DAC extensions and the diagnostic reports such DAC extensions.

### New Acuminator Diagnostics for Graphs and Graph Extensions
- The [PX1077](diagnostics/PX1077.md) diagnostic forbids private graph event handlers. The code fix for the diagnostic will attempt to change a private event handler into a `protected virtual` method. The diagnostic has been implemented by the external contributor [Kemal Taskin](https://github.com/taskinkemal). His contribution is much appreciated.
- The new [PX1111](diagnostics/PX1111.md) diagnostic detects processing views with main DACs that do not declare a `NoteID` field.
- The new [PX1112](diagnostics/PX1112.md) diagnostic requires that graphs and graph extensions with generic type parameters are marked as abstract classes. An accompanying code fix adds the `abstract` modifier to the graph or graph extension declaration.
- The new [PX1113](diagnostics/PX1113.md) diagnostic checks that graphs and graph extensions are not marked as `sealed` types. An accompanying code fix removes the `sealed` modifier from graphs and graph extensions.
- The new [PX1114](diagnostics/PX1114.md) diagnostic reports graph extensions that inherit from **terminal** graph extensions. A **terminal graph extension** is one of the two:
  - **Non-abstract and non-generic graph extension**: A concrete graph extension without generic type parameters.
  - **Abstract graph extension with the `PXProtectedAccess` attribute**: An abstract graph extension decorated with the `PXProtectedAccess` attribute.

### New Acuminator Diagnostics for the `PXOverride` Methods
Acuminator 4.0.0 contains a new set of diagnostics to validate best practices for the work with the `PXOverride` methods:
- The new [PX1079](diagnostics/PX1079.md) diagnostic prohibits `PXOverride` methods without an additional delegate parameter for calling the base method. An accompanying code fix adds an additional delegate parameter to the `PXOverride` method. The type of the generated parameter matches the signature of the base method and the name of the delegate parameter is generated according to the naming conventions of Acumatica Framework.
- The new [PX1097](diagnostics/PX1097.md) diagnostic forbids non-public or virtual `PXOverride` methods. The code fix changes the accessibility of the `PXOverride` method to `public` and removes `virtual` modifier from the method declaration.
- The new [PX1098](diagnostics/PX1098.md) diagnostic requires from the `PXOverride` method to have an XML documentation comment with a reference to its base method. The XML documentation comment should have the following format 
   ```C#
   /// Overrides <seealso cref="{Base method}">
   ```
   The code fix for the diagnostic generates the correct XML documentation comment for the `PXOverride` method.
- The new [PX1100](diagnostics/PX1100.md) diagnostic detects and reports `PXOverride` methods that override obsolete base methods marked with the `System.ObsoleteAttribute`.
- The new [PX1101](diagnostics/PX1101.md) diagnostic checks that the additional delegate parameter of the `PXOverride` method has the same signature as the base method. An accompanying code fix corrects the type of the delegate parameter to match the signature of the base method. It also changes the name of the delegate parameter according to the naming conventions of Acumatica Framework.
- The new [PX1102](diagnostics/PX1102.md) diagnostic checks that the additional delegate parameter of the `PXOverride` method has a name conforming Acumatica naming conventions. The name of the delegate parameter must start with `base_` followed by the name of the base method being overridden. An accompanying code fix renames the delegate parameter to the correct name.

### Updates in Diagnostics for the Asynchronous Code
- The existing [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md) diagnostic that reports captures of screen graph by a delegate closure was enhanced to support `ILongOperationManager` and `IGraphLongOperationManager` interfaces. It now also performs the analysis of process delegates set via the `SetAsyncProcessDelegate` method.
- The [PX1013](diagnostics/PX1013.md), [PX1046](diagnostics/PX1046.md), [PX1054](diagnostics/PX1054.md), [PX1080](diagnostics/PX1080.md), and [PX1086](diagnostics/PX1086.md) diagnostics that made checks related to long-running operations were updated to support `ILongOperationManager` and `IGraphLongOperationManager` interfaces.
- The new [PX1038](diagnostics/PX1038.md) diagnostic forbids `async void` methods, lambdas and anonymous methods.
- The new [PX1099](diagnostics/PX1099.md) diagnostic forbids several .Net APIs used for writing the asynchronous and concurrent code.
- The new [PX1120](diagnostics/PX1120.md) diagnostic reports incorrect work in the Acumatica asynchronous code with .Net `Task` types such as:
  - `System.Threading.Tasks.Task` and `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<T>`,
  - `System.Threading.Tasks.ValueTask` and `System.Threading.Tasks.ValueTask<T>`.
  
  The asynchronous code working with the Acumatica Framework should adhere the following best practice:
  - The `Task` instance should not be stored in a local variable or a method parameter. 
  - All `Task`-typed expressions should be either awaited or immediately returned. 
  - A method returning a `Task`-typed expression should have the `Task` type as its return type. You cannot have method like this:
    ```C#
    public object GetDelayTaskAsync() => Task.Delay(100);
    ```

### Other New Diagnostics
- The new [PX1115](diagnostics/PX1115.md) diagnostic checks that higher-level DAC and graph extensions have only **terminal** extensions as their *base* extensions. **Terminal DAC extension** is simply a non-abstract DAC extension. **Terminal graph extensions** have been described above in the description of the new [PX1114](diagnostics/PX1114.md) diagnostic.
- The new [PX1116](diagnostics/PX1116.md) diagnostic checks for circular references in the type hierarchy of graph and DAC extensions.

### Improvements in Existing Diagnostics
- The diagnostic and code fix messages were updated to be more accurate and clear for [PX1000](diagnostics/PX1000.md), [PX1013](diagnostics/PX1013.md), [PX1041](diagnostics/PX1041.md), [PX1054](diagnostics/PX1054.md), and [PX1086](diagnostics/PX1086.md) diagnostics.
- The analysis in the [PX1001](diagnostics/PX1001.md) diagnostic has been optimized.
- The [PX1002](diagnostics/PX1002.md) diagnostic has been enhanced for more precise analysis by improving support for Acumatica Framework's aggregator attributes.
- The [PX1003](diagnostics/PX1003.md) diagnostic has been improved in the following ways:
  - The text of the diagnostic message for the [PX1003](diagnostics/PX1003.md) diagnostic has been changed to have a clearer meaning.
  - The [PX1003](diagnostics/PX1003.md) diagnostic now has an accompanying code fix that will replace the `new PXGraph()` expression with a call to the factory method `PXGraph.CreateInstance<PXGraph>()`. 
  - Acuminator will now provide a default justification for suppression comments generated for the [PX1003](diagnostics/PX1003.md) diagnostic.
- The [PX1005](diagnostics/PX1005.md) diagnostic has been reworked to look for typos both in view and action delegates. The diagnostic now supports the scenario when a view or an action is declared in base types of a graph or a graph extension. The accompanying code fix has been extended to fix action delegate names. 
- The existing [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md) diagnostic was enhanced in several ways: 
  - The diagnostic now reports captures of screen graph by a delegate closure was enhanced to support `ILongOperationManager` and `IGraphLongOperationManager` interfaces.
  - The diagnostic now performs the analysis of process delegates set via the `SetAsyncProcessDelegate` method. 
  - The diagnostic was updated to check record types.
  - The diagnostic was optimized.
- The [PX1012](diagnostics/PX1012.md) diagnostic has been optimized to use pre-calculated semantic information for graph.
- The [PX1016](diagnostics/PX1016.md) diagnostic has received the following enhancements:
  - The severity of the [PX1016](diagnostics/PX1016.md) diagnostic has been changed from **Error** to **Warning** to indicate that the absence of the `IsActive` method does not lead to runtime errors.
  - The [PX1016](diagnostics/PX1016.md) diagnostic now reports workflow graph extensions without the `IsActive` method if they contain business logic such as event handlers, graph actions, graph views, graph action and view delegates, and the `PXOverride` methods.
  - The [PX1016](diagnostics/PX1016.md) diagnostic now reports the missing `IsActive` method for abstract graph extensions with `PXProtectedAccessAttribute`. Previously, this diagnostic did not analyze abstract graph extensions.
- The [PX1022](diagnostics/PX1022.md) diagnostic has been extended to report non-public DACs and graphs.
- The [PX1027](diagnostics/PX1027.md) diagnostic for forbidden words in names of DACs and DAC fields has been extended with new checks:
  - The [PX1027](diagnostics/PX1027.md) diagnostic now checks that DAC field names do not start with the "**Company**" prefix.
  - The [PX1027](diagnostics/PX1027.md) diagnostic now reports forbidden DAC field names: "**Notes**", "**Files**", and "**DatabaseRecordStatus**".
  - The [PX1027](diagnostics/PX1027.md) diagnostic was optimized to use the already collected semantic information about DAC fields.
- The [PX1031](diagnostics/PX1031.md) diagnostic now allows the `ToString` method to be overridden in DACs and DAC extensions.
- The [PX1047](diagnostics/PX1047.md) and [PX1048](diagnostics/PX1048.md) diagnostics now support variables declared with C# recursive patterns and variables declared with with C# `is not`, `is var`, and positional patterns.
- The [PX1048](diagnostics/PX1048.md) diagnostic has been updated to prohibit changes to other DACs from the `FieldUpdating` event handlers, in line with new established best practices of Acumatica Framework.
- The diagnostics for graph initialization [PX1054](diagnostics/PX1054.md), [PX1057](diagnostics/PX1057.md), [PX1058](diagnostics/PX1058.md), [PX1059](diagnostics/PX1059.md), [PX1081](diagnostics/PX1081.md), [PX1082](diagnostics/PX1082.md), [PX1085](diagnostics/PX1085.md) have been extended to consider the `Configure` and `Initialize` methods of graphs and graph extensions as part of the graph initialization.
- The severity of [PX1060](diagnostics/PX1060.md) and [PX1061](diagnostics/PX1061.md) diagnostics was changed from **Information** to **Warning** to indicate that DAC fields should support fluent BQL queries.
- The [PX1073](diagnostics/PX1073.md) diagnostic now reports exceptions thrown in the `FieldUpdating` event handler. The only allowed exceptions in `FieldUpdating` event handlers are `NotImplementedException`, `NotSupportedException`, and `ArgumentException` (including its descendants `ArgumentNullException` and `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`).
- The [PX1075](diagnostics/PX1075.md) diagnostic was extended to forbid `PXCache.RaiseExceptionHandling` calls in `FieldUpdating` event handlers. The analysis of the diagnostic was also optimized.
- The [PX1086](diagnostics/PX1086.md) diagnostic was reworked to detect `PXSetupNotEnteredException` exceptions thrown by the calls to external helpers via the inter-procedural analysis.
- The [PX1093](diagnostics/PX1093.md) diagnostic has been reworked and significantly optimized thanks to the re-use of the already collected graph semantic information in its analysis.
- The support of the typed `PXCache<TNode>` APIs has been added to the [PX1044](diagnostics/PX1044.md), [PX1059](diagnostics/PX1059.md), and [PX1075](diagnostics/PX1075.md) diagnostics.
- Collection of semantic information has been improved:
  - Collection of semantic information for graphs, DACs, and their extensions has been completely reworked to be more accurate and performant.
  - Acuminator can now retrieve semantic information from external DLLs.
- The collection of information about Acumatica event handlers was completely reworked to collect more details and be much more accurate. As a result, Acuminator now can recognize overrides of event handlers and run on them existing event handler validations.
- Acuminator now supports graph extensions with complex non-linear type hierarchies. Such type hierarchies appear when a higher-level graph extension extends multiple independent graph extensions like this:
  ```C#
  // ExtensionA and ExtensionB are independent extensions
  ExtensionA : PXGraphExtension<SomeGraph>
  ExtensionB : PXGraphExtension<SomeGraph>
  ExtensionC : PXGraphExtension<ExtensionA, ExtensionB, SomeGraph>

      SomeGraph
      /        \
  ExtensionA   ExtensionB 
      \        /
      ExtensionC
  ```
- The support for the `PXBqlTable` base DAC type has been added to the Acuminator code analysis.
- A common base class `PXCodeFixProvider` with common boilerplate logic for code fix registration has been added to Acuminator and integrated with the Acuminator code fix providers.
- Support of `PK`s with size more than **8** key fields has been added to the `PK`/`FK` diagnostics. The maximum supported key size of `PK`s now is **12** fields.
- The implicit object creation with the `new()` syntax in C# is now supported by Acuminator code analysis.
- A number of various optimizations in the code analysis have been implemented.
- Other enhancements. 

### Enhancements: Acuminator Console Runner
A big part of the new Acuminator 4.0.0 release is the new **Acuminator Console Runner** tool. **Acuminator Console Runner** is a standalone command-line tool that serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for Acuminator code analysis and allows to run it outside of IDE. Such tool is useful for CI/CD pipelines and other automated scenarios. The name of the executable file is *Acuminator.Runner.NetFramework.exe*. The tool requires .NET Framework 4.8 runtime.

Acuminator Console Runner supports analysis of .NET solutions (*.sln*) and projects (*.csproj*). It also provides several command line arguments to configure the code analysis and the format of the generated report. Run the tool with `--help` argument to see the documentation for all supported command line arguments in the console.

All command line arguments can be divided into the following three groups:
- **Code analysis arguments**: These arguments control how the code analysis is performed. All Acuminator code analysis settings can be configured through these command line arguments.
- **Output arguments**: These arguments control how the results of the code analysis are reported. You can also configure the grouping of found Acuminator errors by source file and/or diagnostic ID.
- **Other arguments**: These additional arguments control different aspects of the Acuminator Console Runner.

Here is an example of how you can run Acuminator Console Runner from the command line:
```powershell
Acuminator.Runner.NetFramework.exe <path to the solution/project> --verbosity Debug --format json -f <path to output file> -g <grouping> --enable-PX1007 --disable-PX1099
```
You can find the description of the Acuminator Console Runner and all available command line arguments on the [documentation page for the tool](AcuminatorCLI.md). 

### Enhancements: Code Map

#### New Filter Box
Code Map now has a new filter box that gives you an ability to filter tree nodes by input string and quickly find necessary info in complex DACs and graphs:

![Code Map Filter Box](images/CodeMap_FilterBox.png)

The filtering of the Code Map tree works with both regular Code Map nodes and attributes. You can use it to check whether:
- A DAC declares a particular DAC field.
- A graph declares an event handler for particular DAC of DAC field.
- There is a particular attribute on a DAC field property or a cache attached event handler. 

#### Display of Base Types and Advanced Navigation
In Acuminator 4.0.0, the Code Map has multiple new features that will make it much more useful for customization developers:
 - For graphs and DACs, the Code Map now displays their base graphs and DACs and dynamically loads information for them on demand. For graph and DAC extensions, the Code Map now displays both their base graph or DAC and their base extensions.
   ![Code Map With Base Graph](images/CodeMap_BaseGraph.png)
 - Acuminator code analysis and the Code Map now have the capability to collect information from external DLLs. As a result, the Code Map displays the base types for external extensions. This may be useful for all customization scenarios where an extension from a separate customization project customizes a graph or DAC from a core Acumatica DLLs.
 - Navigation in the Code Map has been improved. The Acuminator integration with Visual Studio has been significantly improved in the new release. Now the Code Map relies on Visual Studio to navigate into metadata and decompiled source code. You can navigate to the source code of base graphs and DACs located in external Acumatica DLLs directly from the Code Map.

#### New Settings Page and Code Map Expansion Options
Acuminator now includes a new settings page for the Code Map in Visual Studio options. The new settings page gives you an ability to configure the new Code Map expansion options: 
- Always expand all root nodes (DACs, graphs, and extensions). **True** by default.
- Always expand all attribute nodes. **False** by default.
- Always expand all regular nodes (everything that is not root and not attribute). **True** by default.

#### New Information Displayed in Code Map
- The Code Map now displays attributes declared on DACs and graphs. The attribute nodes are placed into a separate grouping node.
- The Code Map for DACs has been reworked to display a list of **DAC fields** instead of **DAC field properties**. 
  - The difference between a DAC field and DAC field property is that **DAC field** represents a complete information about the data field. A DAC field is a pair of a BQL field and C# property. On the other hand, the **DAC field property** is only the C# property part of the data field. 
  - The Code Map now displays a list of DAC field nodes. Each DAC field node has one or two sub-nodes: one for the BQL field, and one for the C# property. The node representing the C# property has sub-nodes for all attributes declared on the property.
  - The DAC field node and its sub-nodes support advanced tooltips:
    - The tooltip for the DAC field node displays the declaration of all attributes declared on the C# property. The same tooltip is displayed for the C# property node.
    - The tooltip for the attribute node displays the declaration of this attribute on the C# property.
    - The tooltip for the BQL field node displays the declaration of the BQL field class. 
  - The DAC field node supports cycling navigation. You can navigate between a BQL field node and a C# property node by double-clicking on the DAC field node multiple times.
- The Code Map for DACs got several new grouping nodes for different types of DAC members:
  - A new grouping node for audit DAC fields. A special new icon was added to indicate that a field is an audit DAC field.
  - A new grouping node for system non-audit DAC fields. This node should contain nodes for `timestamp`, `NoteID`, `Attributes`, and other system DAC fields that are not audit fields. A special new icon was added to indicate that a field is a system non-audit DAC field.
  - A new grouping node for C# properties of a DAC that do not have a corresponding BQL field.
- The `IsActiveFor<TGraph>` method of a graph extension is now displayed in the Code Map in the **Initialization & Activation** category.
- The `Initialize` method of graph extensions and graphs implementing the `IGraphWithInitialization` interface is now displayed in the Code Map in the **Initialization & Activation** category.
- The `Configure` method of graphs and graph extensions is now displayed in the Code Map in the **Initialization & Activation** category.
- The Code Map now includes a new visual indicator icon for projection DACs and projection attributes, helping you to quickly identify them.
- The Code Map now includes a new visual indicator icon for `PXAccumulator` attributes and DACs with the `PXAccumulator` attribute declared on them. The term `PXAccumulator` attribute here includes attributes derived from the `PXAccumulatorAttribute` type.
- The collection of information about Acumatica event handlers was completely reworked to collect more details and be much more accurate. As a result, Acuminator now can recognize overrides of event handlers and display them in the Code Map.
- The user-friendly DAC name from the `PXCacheNameAttribute` attribute is now displayed in the Code Map node for the DAC and in the Code Map node for the `PXCacheNameAttribute` attribute.

#### Other Code Map Enhancements
- The text for the indicator of read-only graph views has been changed from "**Uncached**" to "**ReadOnly**" to use a term more familiar to Acumatica developers.
- Icons have been added to attribute nodes and attribute group nodes.
- The Code Map tree is now refreshed on Visual Studio theme changes.
- The Code Map now supports separate icons for light and dark Visual Studio themes.
- Two versions of icons for light and dark themes were added for nodes with icons badly displayed in the light theme.
 
### Fixed Bugs 

#### Acuminator Code Analysis
- Acuminator could crash Visual Studio with a stack overflow exception if a specific graph or DAC extension with an incorrect type hierarchy was typed in the code editor. If the type hierarchy of the extension contained a cyclic reference, then the collection of the information from the type hierarchy went into an endless loop until a stack overflow exception was thrown which crashed Visual Studio.
- Code fixes for [PX1000](diagnostics/PX1000.md), [PX1013](diagnostics/PX1013.md), [PX1040](diagnostics/PX1040.md), and [PX1042](diagnostics/PX1042.md) diagnostics were fixed to support methods and constructors with expression bodies.
- The support for parameters in action delegates was fixed in code fixes for diagnostics [PX1000](diagnostics/PX1000.md) and [PX1013](diagnostics/PX1013.md).
- The [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic incorrectly determined the mapped DAC field of the projection DAC in cases when projection DAC was derived from one of the DACs in its projection query. The projection DACs derived from other DACs have implicit mappings for DAC fields inherited from base DACs. This distinction is frequently used by developers to simplify the code and avoid explicit declaration of multiple `BqlField`/`BqlTable` mappings. The bugfix adds the recognition of this pattern to the [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic.
- The [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md) diagnostic threw a stack overflow exception during the analysis of a specific code containing local functions. During the analysis of a local function that calls its containing method the [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md) diagnostic would go into an endless loop until a stack overflow exception was thrown. 
- The [PX1012](diagnostics/PX1012.md) diagnostic received minor bug fixes.
- In the [PX1012](diagnostics/PX1012.md), [PX1062](diagnostics/PX1062.md), and [PX1072](diagnostics/PX1072.md) diagnostics, mass code fixes have been improved.
- The [PX1015](diagnostics/PX1015.md) diagnostic had an issue that could cause a stack overflow and Visual Studio crash on certain code bases that contained code working with generic type arguments with specific constraints.
- The [PX1015](diagnostics/PX1015.md) diagnostic displayed false alerts for fluent BQL queries about incorrect number of arguments passed to the query. The bugfix disables the [PX1015](diagnostics/PX1015.md) diagnostic for fluent BQL queries.
- The [PX1022](diagnostics/PX1022.md) diagnostic did not support `partial` types and non-standard order of access modifiers.
- The [PX1027](diagnostics/PX1027.md) diagnostic displayed false alert for classes nested in DACs that are not BQL fields but have forbidden names. 
- A null reference exception has been fixed in the [PX1030](diagnostics/PX1030.md) diagnostic.
- In DACs with both regular and dirty primary keys, the [PX1035](diagnostics/PX1035.md) diagnostic incorrectly considered dirty primary key to be a duplicate of the regular key.
- The [PX1033](diagnostics/PX1033.md), [PX1034](diagnostics/PX1034.md), [PX1035](diagnostics/PX1035.md), [PX1036](diagnostics/PX1036.md), and [PX1037](diagnostics/PX1037.md) diagnostics incorrectly relied on the `PXPrimaryGraph` attribute to check whether a DAC supports default navigation. After bugfix the diagnostic uses the `PXPrimaryGraphBase` attribute instead.
- The [PX1036](diagnostics/PX1036.md) diagnostic incorrectly reported dirty primary keys as having an incorrect name.
- The [PX1042](diagnostics/PX1042.md) diagnostic displayed false alert on **Acumatica 2023 R1** and higher. This diagnostic checks that in a `RowSelecting` handler database queries must be executed only inside a separate connection scope. After changes implemented in the Acumatica Framework in **Acumatica 2023 R1** this rule became unnecessary and the diagnostic should have been disabled. However, the [PX1042](diagnostics/PX1042.md) still incorrectly reported a false alert which was addressed in the new Acuminator release.
- The [PX1048](diagnostics/PX1048.md) diagnostic had minor issue with handling the `is` pattern.
- The [PX1060](diagnostics/PX1060.md) diagnostic and code fix did not support the special `Attributes` DAC field from the legacy **Attributes** Acumatica mechanism.
- The [PX1060](diagnostics/PX1060.md) diagnostic and code fix did not support the C# nullable reference types feature and DAC field properties with nullable annotations.
- The [PX1063](diagnostics/PX1063.md) and [PX1064](diagnostics/PX1064.md) diagnostics failed when C# nullable context was enabled for a file.
- The [PX1075](diagnostics/PX1075.md) diagnostic contained a legacy bug which made the diagnostic display errors for `PXCache.RaiseExceptionHandling` calls for all types of event handlers besides `FieldSelecting` event handlers when it was executed in the *non-ISV* mode. This contradicted the existing documentation for the [PX1075](diagnostics/PX1075.md) diagnostic.
- Small bugs in the [PX1077](diagnostics/PX1077.md) diagnostic have been fixed for better performance and readability, including support for diagnostic suppression.
- The [PX1095](diagnostics/PX1095.md) diagnostic displayed false alert for attributes with dynamic DB boundness inherited from `PXEntityAttribute` when their DB boundness was specified explicitly via the `IsDbField` property. A new recursive algorithm for calculation of the attribute's DB boundness from the attribute application in code and metadata was introduced in the new release. The new algorithm supports complex scenarios with aggregator attributes and attributes with the dynamic DB boundness.
- In the [PX1096](diagnostics/PX1096.md) diagnostic, collection of base types of a graph extensions has been fixed: Some of the base extension types were skipped during the search for a suitable base method which led to a false alert. 
- The generation of Acuminator diagnostic suppression comments received several fixes:
  - The suppression comments now can be generated in attribute lists like this:
    ```C#
    [PXDBInt, PXUIField]
    public int? SomeField { get; set; }
    ```
  - The suppression comments now can be generated in chained constructor calls.
  - The suppression comments now can be generated in the parameters list of a method, constructor, or an indexer.

#### Code Map
- A tooltip for the indicator of a processing graph extension (graph extension with a processing graph view) has been fixed.
- An integration with the Visual Studio navigation journal has been added to the Code Map. Now, the Code Map correctly supports the `Navigate Backward` and `Navigate Forward` Visual Studio actions. As a result, you can navigate in the Code Map and return to the original location by using the `Navigate Backward` action.
- The `PXSetupOptional` and `PXSetupOptionalWhere` setup view types were not displayed as setup views in the Code Map.
- Code Map icons were very poorly scaled on monitors with DPI resolution higher than **Full HD**.

#### Other Bug Fixes
- The name and description of the Acuminator suppression mechanism setting in Visual Studio Options have been improved for clarity.

### Other Changes

#### Enhancements in Acuminator Test Infrastructure
The Acuminator test infrastructure has been improved with multiple features:
- The Acumatica DLLs used by Acuminator unit test infrastructure have been updated. New Acumatica DLLs are retrieved from **Acumatica 2026 R1 Preview 1**. The test sources have been updated to work with new Acumatica DLLs for the majority of the unit tests.
- New tests for reading and writing Acuminator settings between processes have been added. The new tests include tests for serialization and deserialization of Acuminator settings. An additional console application `ExternalRunner` has been added to the test infrastructure to support the new tests. 
- New unit tests that check the analysis of code with DLL dependencies have been added. An additional DLL library `ExternalDependency` has been added to the tests infrastructure to support the new tests.
- Reporting of failed unit tests in the test infrastructure has been improved.
- A new prompt file **`UnitTests.prompt.md`** has been added. The file contains AI guidelines for generation of Acuminator unit tests in the repository. 

#### Enhancements in Acuminator Documentation
The new release brings many changes in the documentation for Acuminator diagnostics:
- The documentation for the [PX1001](diagnostics/PX1001.md) and [PX1003](diagnostics/PX1003.md) diagnostics has been rewritten.
- The documentation for the [PX1000](diagnostics/PX1000.md), [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md), [PX1013](diagnostics/PX1013.md), [PX1046](diagnostics/PX1046.md), [PX1054](diagnostics/PX1054.md), [PX1080](diagnostics/PX1080.md), and [PX1086](diagnostics/PX1086.md) diagnostics has been significantly updated.
- The documentation for the [PX1096](diagnostics/PX1096.md) diagnostic had incorrect information that `PXOverride` methods should be `virtual`. The documentation was updated with the information that `PXOverride` methods must not be `virtual`.
- The documentation pages were added for all new diagnostics.
- The documentation for updated diagnostics has been extended.
- The code examples in the existing documentation have been updated with changes from the Acumatica Framework.

#### Enhancements in Acumatica Code Snippets
- The `PXBqlTable` DAC base type has been integrated into Acumatica Code Snippets for DACs.
- The `inheritdoc` XML documentation tag referencing the C# property was added to DAC BQL fields in Acumatica Code Snippets for DACs. 
- In the code snippet for the string DAC field the `string` property type of the C# property was made nullable. 
- Deployment of Acuminator Code Snippets has been reworked.

#### Other Enhancements
- Roslyn packages used by Acuminator have been updated to version **3.11.0**.
- Visual Studio SDK packages have been updated to version **16**.
- The nullable types feature from C# 8 has been integrated into Acuminator code base which improved the quality of the code and reduced a number of boilerplate null checks.
- A new work mode has been added to Acuminator. It enables reporting of all *not suppressed* errors with their accurate locations and generates or updates the Acuminator global suppression file for the analyzed project at the same time.
- The legacy strong signing process of .NET assemblies has been removed from Acuminator.
- The Acumatica logo has been updated.
- Other improvements and refactorings.

## Acuminator 3.1.3: October 24, 2023
Acuminator 3.1.3 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 3.1.3, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - The Acuminator code refactoring mechanism that changed weakly typed old graph event handlers into strongly typed generic event handlers has been converted into a new diagnostic [PX1041](diagnostics/PX1041.md).  
   The default severity of the new diagnostic is **Information** because Acumatica Framework supports both types of event handlers. Now you can use the new diagnostic to convert graph event handlers to generic ones in the entire document, project, and solution.
 - The category of Acuminator diagnostics has been changed to **"Acuminator"**. You can see this category in **Error List** window of Visual Studio if you group diagnostics by **Category** as shown in the following screenshot.<br/>
 ![Errors grouped by category](images/ErrorList_GroupedByCategory.png)<br/>
  
### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
- Visual Studio 17.7 crashed when the static code analysis was configured to be executed in the Visual Studio process (*in process mode*). 
  The crashes were caused by the asynchronous code in old Acuminator analyzers. 


## Acuminator 3.1.2: June 8, 2023
Acuminator 3.1.2 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 3.1.2, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - The [PX1096](diagnostics/PX1096.md) diagnostic has been added to check the signature of methods with the `PXOverride` attribute: The diagnostic checks whether the base graph or base graph extensions contain a base method that is compatible with the `PXOverride` method. 
 - The [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic has been updated in the following ways:
   - The diagnostic now supports the `inheritdoc` tag for DACs, DAC extensions, and their properties. The diagnostic also checks that mapped DAC field properties of projection DACs have the `inheritdoc` tag with the `cref` attribute pointing to the corresponding DAC field property of the original DAC. 
   - A new code fix can generate the `inheritdoc` tag for a mapped DAC property of a projection DAC.
     This code fix also removes incorrect documentation tags such as `summary` or incorrectly declared `inheritdoc`.
   - Code fixes of the diagnostic can now generate documentation correctly even for badly formatted code. Also, in the properties of mapped fields of projection DACs, incorrect documentation tags can be removed. The code fixes also support documentation tags declared as empty XML elements, such as `<summary/>`.
   - The diagnostic no longer checks the following DAC fields for a code annotation:
     - `Selected`
     - `Attributes`
     - `GroupMask`
     - `CompanyID`
     - `CompanyMask`
     - `DeletedDatabaseRecord`
   - The **Suppress with a local comment** code fix of Acuminator now supports the **Fix All** functionality of Visual Studio for the [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic. The diagnostic can be suppressed for a whole DAC. Suppressing the diagnostic could be useful when you do not plan to write the documentation immediately and want to leave it to the documentation team.
 
### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
 - In Visual Studio 2022, Acuminator analysis did not work in the out-of-process mode (that is, when the **Run code analysis in separate process** check box is selected in Visual Studio options). 
 - The [PX1023](diagnostics/PX1023.md) diagnostic showed a false alert for the `INUnit` attribute.
 - It was possible to suppress the [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic for DAC extensions by marking the class with the `PXHidden` attribute.
 - The [PX1016](diagnostics/PX1016.md) diagnostic showed a false alert for generic non-abstract graph extensions.

## Acuminator 3.1.1
Acuminator 3.1.1 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 3.1.1, the following enhancements have been implemented:
- The [PX1042](diagnostics/PX1042.md) diagnostic has been changed to reflect the changes in Acumatica Platform. Starting with Acumatica ERP 2023 R1, Acumatica runtime has been changed to allow execution of database queries in the `RowSelecting` event handler without a separate connection scope. Therefore, in Acumatica ERP 2023 R1 and later versions, this diagnostic is disabled.
- Localization diagnostics [PX1050](diagnostics/PX1050.md), [PX1051](diagnostics/PX1051.md), and [PX1053](diagnostics/PX1053.md) have been enhanced to support the `PX.Objects.Common.Exceptions.PXExceptionInfo` class. This class represents a data transfer object frequently used in Acumatica code to store data about exceptions. Localization diagnostics will treat this data the same way they treat Acumatica Framework exceptions derived from `PXException` as follows:
   - Check that hard-coded strings are not passed as arguments to the `PXExceptionInfo` constructor calls. Only localizable string constants can be passed to the `PXExceptionInfo` constructor.
   - Do not report error when the `PXExceptionInfo.MessageFormat` property is passed to APIs checked by Acuminator localization diagnostics, such as `PXException` constructor calls.
- The [PX1016](diagnostics/PX1016.md) diagnostic has been changed to not check for the `IsActive` method in graph extensions that include the override of the `Configure` method with the screen configuration and workflows. Information about the `Configure` method has been added to the graph semantic model.
- The [PX1018](diagnostics/PX1018.md) diagnostic has been updated to not show a warning about abstract graphs and generic graphs that have a generic type parameter as their primary DAC.

#### Analysis of Data Type Attributes and DAC Field DB Boundness Calculation
The Acuminator analysis of Acumatica data type attributes has been significantly reworked:
- Calculation of relationships between Acumatica attributes has been improved.
- The unbound [PXVariantAttribute](https://help.acumatica.com/(W(98))/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=92f5623d-eebb-e5e7-db17-5aa98633b219) is now supported.

The heuristic calculation of DAC field's relationship with a database (which we call _DB boundness_) has been significantly improved:
- The set of possible DB boundness values has been extended. Previously, Acuminator could calculate only four types of DAC field's DB boundness: _NotDefined_, _Unbound_, _DbBound_, and _Unknown_.<br/> 
	Now Acuminator displays three more values: 
	- _PXDBScalar_
	- _PXDBCalced_
	- _Error_ (for the case when Acuminator can prove that the data type attributes on a DAC field property are declared incorrectly)
	These new values are displayed in the Code Map for DACs and DAC extensions. The _Error_ value is displayed in the Code Map as __"Inconsistent"__.
- Support for Acumatica aggregator attributes in the DB boundness calculation has been improved.<br/> 
Aggregator attributes are attributes derived from the [PXAggregateAttribute](https://help.acumatica.com/(W(98))/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=9c64f185-b2a4-14ee-eef1-d78c0e05d100) class. They can combine functionality from several attributes:
  ```C#
  [PXDBInt]
  [PXUIField(DisplayName = "Customer")]
  [PXDefault]
  [PXSelector(typeof(Search<BAccountR.bAccountID,
              Where<BAccountR.status, Equal<BAccount.status.active>>>))]
  public class CustomerActiveAttribute : PXAggregateAttribute { }
          
  public class ARInvoice : IBqlTable
  {
    [CustomerActive]
    public override Int32? CustomerID { get; set; }
  }
  ``` 
- Calculation of DB boundness has been improved to support hybrid data type attributes with mixed DB boundness. Such attributes can be placed on both bound and unbound DAC field properties. They usually have the `IsDBField` (or `NonDB` in case of `PXDBLocalizableStringAttribute`) flag which configures the attribute's DB boundness. The flag may have a default value, also it could be explicitly set on the attribute's declaration on a DAC field property or an aggregator attribute. Acumatica code includes a number of such attributes: `PeriodIDAttribute`, `PXEntityAttribute`, and attributes derived from them. They are supported in the new release.
- The DB boundness calculation now supports combinations of hybrid and aggregator attributes and combines the default DB boundness with the DB boundness explicitly set on attribute's application on a DAC field property or an aggregator attribute.
- The calculated attribute's DB boundness and information about the attribute's data type is now cached in the DAC semantic model and shared between Acuminator DAC analyzers.

The changes in the attribute analysis provided an ability to make significant improvements in the following diagnostics:
- The [PX1095](diagnostics/PX1095.md) diagnostic now supports both `PXDBCalcedAttribute` and `PXDBScalarAttribute` attributes. Any of them, when used on a DAC field property, requires an unbound data type attribute like `PXStringAttribute` placed on the same DAC field property. Previously, the PX1095 diagnostic checked only `PXDBCalcedAttribute` but starting from this release both attributes are checked.
- The precision and performance of the following diagnostics has been improved:
  - [PX1019](diagnostics/PX1019.md)
  - [PX1020](diagnostics/PX1020.md)
  - [PX1021](diagnostics/PX1021.md)
  - [PX1023](diagnostics/PX1023.md)
  - [PX1030](diagnostics/PX1030.md)
  - [PX1095](diagnostics/PX1095.md)
  
### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
- The published version 3.1 of the `Acuminator.Analyzers` nuget package was corrupted and did not work. The nuget package is fixed in this release.
- Graph Semantic Model incorrectly collected actions, action delegates, views, and view delegates for non-generic graph extensions derived from other graph extensions. This led to different possible bugs in static code analysis of graphs and graph extensions. The Code Map also displayed incorrect data. 
- The [PX1091](diagnostics/PX1091.md) diagnostic did not report error in a scenarios involving a graph action with an action delegate and a class hierarchy of graph extensions. In particular, the error was not reported in a scenario with a `Base` and `Derived` graph extensions when the action delegate was re-declared in `Base` and overridden in `Derived`, and the override calls the base action delegate from the graph via extension's `Base` property.  
- The false alert in the [PX1091](diagnostics/PX1091.md) diagnostic for a call to the base action delegate method via `base` keyword in the action delegate method C# override.
- The incorrect resolution of C# property and method overrides which resulted in the incorrect collection of data for the graph extension's `Initialize` method in case of several method overrides.
- Minor bugfixes in code analysis and performance optimizations.

### Other Changes
Stability of the Acuminator tests infrastructure has been improved in the following ways:
  - Validation of the test initial state has been added
  - Error processing for failed tests has been enhanced
 

## Acuminator 3.1
Acuminator 3.1 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 3.1, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - The [PX1062](diagnostics/PX1062.md) diagnostic has been added to make sure that graphs and graph extensions do not contain static actions, views, or other static mutable fields and properties.
 - The following new diagnostics have been added to prevent errors related to the serialization and deserialization of exceptions: 
   - The [PX1063](diagnostics/PX1063.md) diagnostic ensures that the exception classes derived from `System.Exception` always declare a serialization constructor.
   - The [PX1064](diagnostics/PX1064.md) diagnostic ensures that the exception classes derived from `System.Exception` which declare new serializable data, always provide an override of the `GetObjectData` method.
 - Support for the following complex expressions passed to SetProcessDelegate API has been added to the [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md) and [PX1086](diagnostics/PX1086.md) diagnostics:
   - A cast expression as shown in the following example:
     ```C#
	 ProcessProductSync.SetProcessDelegate((PXProcessingBase<KNCASyncDetails>.ProcessListDelegate)delegate
	 {
	    ProductCreateUpdate();
	 });
	 ```
   - An object creation expression as shown in the following example:
     ```C#
	 ProcessProductSync.SetProcessDelegate(new PXProcessingBase<KNCASyncDetails>.ProcessListDelegate(delegate
	 {
		ProductCreateUpdate();
	 }));
	 ```
   - A local variable or parameter that stores the delegate
   - A property or field that stores the delegate
 - The [PX1056](diagnostics/PX1056.md) diagnostic has been added to check whether a graph is created in the `IsActive` or `IsActiveForGraph` method in a graph extension or a DAC extension, and warn you if it is.
 - The [PX1057](diagnostics/PX1057.md) and [PX1084](diagnostics/PX1084.md) diagnostics now prevent graph creation via a direct constructor call&mdash;that is, the `new PXGraph()` method call.
 - The [PX1050](diagnostics/PX1050.md) and [PX1051](diagnostics/PX1051.md) diagnostics now display fewer false alerts and find more cases of incorrect localization, such as interpolation strings.
 
 #### Code Snippets
 Acuminator now provides code snippets for DACs, DAC fields, and graph events. A developer can use these code snippets to speed up the writing of new code and avoid common mistakes.
 You can start using code snippets by typing "dac" or "_" and selecting the appropriate snippet in the IntelliSense code completion list, as shown in the following screenshot.
 <br/>

   For more details on installing and using the code snippets, see [the CodeSnippets repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Acumatica/CodeSnippets). 
   
 #### Improvements in the PX1008 Diagnostic 
 The [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md) diagnostic has been completely reworked. Now this diagnostic implements a data flow analysis that goes recursively into methods and checks how the data is transferred to them.
 The following enhancements have been implemented in the diagnostic:
   - Checks to be sure that when adapters of the `PXAdapter` type are passed to an action delegate in a graph or a graph extension, the adapters are not captured in delegate closures by long-running and processing delegates.
   - Improvements in diagnostic messages
   - Checks that custom views and attributes capture graph and adapter references in a closure of a long run delegate
   - Bug fixes: The diagnostic displayed a warning when capturing a reference to `this` in a delegate even in a class that was not a graph or a graph extension
 
 #### Improvements in the PX1072 Diagnostic 
 The following fixes have been implemented in the [PX1072](diagnostics/PX1072.md) diagnostic:
   - In static graph members, the declaring graph is no longer considered available for usage in BQL or Fluent BQL queries.
   - The diagnostic no longer displays a warning if a single local graph is available and used in a BQL or Fluent BQL query.
   - The diagnostic now displays a warning when a class contains multiple BQL or Fluent BQL queries and there are no available graphs&mdash;that is, graphs instances that already exist and can be used by a BQL query.
 
### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
 - Two Acuminator code fixes, which suppressed Acuminator diagnostic alerts either with a local comment or in the Acuminator suppression file, stopped appearing in the UI in the latest release of Visual Studio 2022.
 - When a diagnostic was suppressed in a global suppression file via a code fix for a project without the Acuminator suppression file, Acuminator incorrectly generated it in Visual Studio 2022. It did not generate the "AdditionalFiles" section in the project file for the generated suppression file.
 - The [PX1086](diagnostics/PX1086.md) diagnostic failed on syntax expressions that create collections with the collection initializer when the constructor braces were omitted.
 - The process of creating a graph semantic model has been improved. Now runtime errors that occurred in diagnostics of graphs and graph extensions have been fixed.
 - The performance of the [PX1073](diagnostics/PX1073.md) and [PX1074](diagnostics/PX1074.md) diagnostics has been improved. Runtime errors during the analysis of a graph extension were fixed in these diagnostics through the removal of the redundant analysis of events from the base graph.
 - Minor bugs with inter-procedural analysis of local functions have been fixed.
 - Acuminator failed during the analysis of code with a graph that is a generic type parameter that is passed to the `PXGraph.InstanceCreated.AddHandler`  method.

### Other Changes
 - Extended design of syntax walkers for inter-procedural analysis has been implemented. Also, extension points and a new API have been added.
 - Nullable reference code analysis and nullable annotations have been introduced to parts of Acuminator. 
 - The design of syntax walkers has been extended for inter-procedural analysis.


## Acuminator 3.0
Acuminator 3.0 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 3.0, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - Acuminator now supports Visual Studio 2022 in addition to the two previous versions of Visual Studio, 2017 and 2019. Also, Acuminator now supports preview versions of Visual Studio. 
 - The [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic now checks only DACs, DAC extensions, and public field properties for these classes.
 - The [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md) diagnostic now validates delegates passed to the `PXLongOperation.StartOperation()` method. You can now find captured references to the graph instance in delegate closures.
 - The [PX1026](diagnostics/PX1026.md) diagnostic now allows underscores in the names of DAC extensions. 
 
 #### Improvements in the Code Map
 The Code Map has been improved in the following ways:
 - Different icons are now displayed for DACs, DAC extensions, graphs, and graph extensions. 
   See the following screenshots for examples of these icons.<br/>
   ![Icons for a DAC and DAC extension](images/CodeMap_DACExtension_Icon.png)<br/>
   ![Icons for a graph and graph extensions](images/CodeMap_GraphExtension_Icon.png)
 - Each DAC node now indicates whether the node represents a DAC or a DAC extension as shown in the previous screenshot.
 - For each graph or a graph extension, overrides of virtual type members are now displayed under the new **Base Overrides** node. The `Persist` method overrides are indicated with a special diskette icon. 
   See the following screenshots for an example of this node.<br/>
   ![The Base Overrides node](images/CodeMap_BaseOverrides.png)
 - The **Initialization and Activation** node has been introduced. It displays the following information:
	- Graph instance and static constructors for graphs and graph extensions
	- The `IsActive` method for a graph extension and a DAC extension 
   See the following screenshots for examples of the **Initialization and Activation** node.<br/>
   ![The Initialization and Activation node for graphs and graph extensions](images/CodeMap_InitAndActive.png)<br/>
   ![The Initialization and Activation node for DACs and DAC extensions](images/CodeMap_DACExtension_InitAndActive.png)
 - The Code Map window is automatically reopened at Visual Studio startup if the Code Map was opened at the last Visual Studio closure.
 
### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
 - Acuminator refactorings did not work when Visual Studio was configured to perform static code analysis in a separate process.
 - The [PX1073](diagnostics/PX1073.md) diagnostic now does not show an error for the exception thrown in the `RowPersisted` event handler of a graph if at least one of the following conditions is met:
      - The graph declaring the `RowPersisted` event handler is a processing graph. For processing graphs all exception types are allowed.
      - The graph declaring the `RowPersisted` event handler is a non-processing graph and the type of the exception is among one of the following exception types or is derived from them:
         - `PX.Data.PXRowPersistedException`
         - `PX.Data.PXLockViolationException`
         - .NET exceptions from the System namespace: `NotImplementedException`, `NotSupportedException`, `ArgumentException` (including its descendants `ArgumentNullException` and `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`)
 
 #### Disabling of Locally Suppressed Diagnostics
 Acuminator provides two different suppression mechanisms to suppress diagnostic alerts in a particular place: a global suppression file and a local suppression with a special comment. The suppression mechanism can be disabled in the Acuminator settings in Visual Studio by specifying False for the following setting: **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Code Analysis > Suppress selected diagnostics**. With this mechanism disabled, you can see all suppressed errors in the legacy code and perform refactoring.
 Previously, you could disable suppression of only globally suppressed diagnostic alerts. Alerts that have been suppressed locally via suppression comments could not be displayed even when the suppression mechanism was turned off. Now Acuminator diagnostics that have been suppressed locally can also be displayed when suppression is disabled. Thus, you can see all errors, including the ones that were suppressed with a comment in the code editor or in the **Error List** tool window. 
 For details on diagnostic suppression, see [Diagnostic Suppression](diagnostics/DiagnosticSuppression.md).
 
### Other Changes 
 - The [PX1088](diagnostics/PX1088.md) diagnostic has been removed because its function is covered by the [PX1008](diagnostics/PX1008.md) diagnostic.
 
### Gratitudes 
The Acuminator team would like to thank our open source contributors: @ShadowFiendZX and @shawnburt. We are grateful for your input and hope you stay with us.

## Acuminator 2.3.2
Acuminator 2.3.2 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 2.3.2, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - The [PX1076](diagnostics/PX1076.md) diagnostic has been added to check for and warn a developer that their code uses Acumatica APIs marked with the PXInternalUseOnly attribute.
 - The documentation for the [PX1046](diagnostics/PX1046.md) diagnostic was extended, the reasoning for the diagnostic is now provided.
 
### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
 - Due to the changes in Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.8.0), Acuminator custom settings were not enabled, and the Acuminator analyzers used default values. Acuminator custom code analysis settings specified by the user did not work with a new 64-bit out of process static code analysis introduced by Visual Studio 2019. When the out of process feature was enabled, only default settings were used.
 - In the [PX1036](diagnostics/PX1036.md) diagnostic, foreign keys for different DACs that use the same set of DAC fields were incorrectly considered as duplicates.
 - Due to the changes in Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.8.2), switching between themes was impossible. 
 - Stability of Acuminator syntax highlighting has been improved.


## Acuminator 2.3.1
Acuminator 2.3.1 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 2.3.1, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - The [PX1037](diagnostics/PX1037.md) diagnostic has been added to verify that a primary, unique, or foreign key declaration does not include an unbound DAC field.
 - The [PX1036](diagnostics/PX1036.md) diagnostic has been updated to check the correct naming of foreign key declarations.
 - The [PX1035](diagnostics/PX1035.md) diagnostic has been changed to check for duplicates with the same sets of fields among unique and foreign keys.
 
### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
 - The Code Map displayed incorrect information about whether a DAC field is bound to database table column or not.
 - The setting of the `IsDBField` parameter in the `Account` and `Sub` attributes and their inheritors was ignored by Acuminator analysis.
 - The calculation of an attribute's bound type was performed incorrectly and did not account for the following factors:
   - Whether the IsDBField property was declared in the attribute's base type
   - What the value of the `NonDB` property of the PXDBLocalizableString attribute was
   - Whether the IsDBField property of the attribute was derived from a standard field type attribute such as PXDBString, PXString, or PXDBCalced.
 - When checking for an unbound attribute used along with `PXDBCalced`, the [PX1095](diagnostics/PX1095.md) diagnostic did not correctly use the attribute's bound type.


## Acuminator 2.3
Acuminator 2.3 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 2.3, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - The [PX1036](diagnostics/PX1036.md) diagnostic has been added to verify the correct naming of key field declarations in the PK API.
 - The [PX1035](diagnostics/PX1035.md) diagnostic has been added to check for and warn the developer of multiple primary key declarations.
 - The [PX1033](diagnostics/PX1033.md) and [PX1034](diagnostics/PX1034.md) diagnostics have been added to suggest adding a PK or FK definition to a DAC.
 - The [PX1016](diagnostics/PX1016.md) diagnostic has been added to check whether a graph or DAC extension has the `IsActive` method implemented.
 - The Code Map has been improved as follows:
   - The Code Map now indicates whether each graph is for mass processing operations and whether each graph node corresponds to a graph or a graph extension.
   - The Code Map now indicates whether each DAC field is auto-incremented (has the `AutoNumberAttribute` attribute).
   - The Code Map performance was greatly optimized. The time for the construction of the Code Map decreased from 3-5 minutes to 1-2 seconds on code files with ~12 000 lines of code
 - The Code Map now displays complementary information about graph views. A developer can see indicators for the following:
   - Views for mass processing operations
   - Setup views
   - Filter views
   - Custom views derived from the base `PXSelect` types
   - Views derived from `PXSelectReadOnly` types   


### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
 - The [PX1015](diagnostics/PX1015.md) diagnostic did not support counting of fluent BQL-like query parameters.
 - The Code Map window frequently became out of sync with active document for various reasons.
 - The error suppression code action was incorrectly displayed when multiple diagnostics reported error on the same syntax node.

## Acuminator 2.2
Acuminator 2.2 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 2.2, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - The [PX1019](diagnostics/PX1019.md) diagnostic has been added to check for DAC fields of a non-string type with the `AutoNumberAttribute` attribute.
 - The [PX1020](diagnostics/PX1020.md) diagnostic has been added to check if the length of a string DAC field with the `AutoNumberAttribute` attribute is sufficient.
 - The [PX1022](diagnostics/PX1022.md) diagnostic has been added to check if a DAC extension or a graph extension is declared as a public class.
 - It is now possible to sort the code map. The context menu of the Acuminator Code Map now includes an active sort indicator and the following new commands: 
   - Sort node's children by declaration order or by name
   - Sort all node descendants by declaration order or by name
   <p>Also, the context menu has been redesigned to better integrate with the Visual Studio style.</p>
 - The following complementary information about DAC fields is displayed in the Code Map in a separate column: the field type, an indicator of whether the field is an identity field, and an indicator of whether the field is bound or unbound.


### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
 - Acuminator failed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
 - The suppression file and Acuminator settings sometimes were loaded incorrectly due to package being loaded by Visual Studio at a random time.

## Acuminator 2.1.3
Acuminator 2.1.3 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Enhancements
In Acuminator 2.1.3, the following enhancements have been implemented:
 - Acuminator now does not perform static analysis of projects whose names contain `Test` or `Benchmark`. Generally, these projects contain tests of an application and do not include any application logic; therefore there is no need to analyze them with Acuminator.
 - The memory usage, performance, and stability of the code map have been improved.
 - The synchronization of the code map with the changes in the DACs has been improved.
 - Now a developer can collapse or expand the selected node (with all its descendant nodes) in the code map if the developer clicks **Collapse All** or **Expand All** (respectively) in the context menu for the selected node.
 - Multiple changes have been made to the [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic to reduce the number of warnings displayed by the diagnostic. For more information about the situations when the diagnostic is not displayed, see the description of the diagnostic in [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md).
 - If a developer suppresses the [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic with a comment, the default comment message is now the following: _Acuminator disable once PX1007 NoXmlCommentForPublicEntityOrDacProperty to be documented later_.
 - The performance of the [PX1021](diagnostics/PX1021.md), [PX1023](diagnostics/PX1023.md), and [PX1095](diagnostics/PX1095.md) diagnostics has been improved.

### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
 - The [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) diagnostic was displayed for partial classes with XML comments on one of the declarations.
 - The [PX1094](diagnostics/PX1094.md) diagnostic was displayed for classes derived from `PXMappedCacheExtension`.
 - Acuminator failed on the Acuminator suppression file if the file had an incorrect XML structure. Now Acuminator validates the XML structure of the suppression file.
 - The Acuminator suppression file was not loaded correctly because Visual Studio prematurely loaded the Acuminator VSIX package.
 - The issues that were caused by the concurrent access of different analyzers to the same Acuminator suppression file have been fixed.

## Acuminator 2.1.2
Acuminator 2.1.2 includes the bug fixes described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
- Suppression of diagnostics in the Acuminator suppression file was not supported for interfaces, structs, enumerations, and delegates.
- The [PX1005](diagnostics/PX1005.md) diagnostic could be incorrectly displayed for data view delegates that have corresponding data views.
- The [PX1032](diagnostics/PX1032.md) diagnostic was incorrectly displayed for extension method calls in DACs.

## Acuminator 2.1.1
Acuminator 2.1.1 includes the bug fixes described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:
- The diagnostics related to localization failed with the `OperationCanceledException` exception when concurrent execution is turned on.
- Acuminator installed from the NuGet package generated warnings about `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces`.

## Acuminator 2.1
Acuminator 2.1 includes the diagnostics, code fixes, enhancements, and bug fixes described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### New Diagnostic and Code Fixes
In this version, the diagnostic and code fixes have been added for the following issue.

| Code                            | Issue Description                                                | Type    | Diagnostics | Code Fix    | 
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [PX1007](diagnostics/PX1007.md) | A public entity or DAC property should have a description in the `summary` XML tag. | Warning (ISV Level 3: Informational)	 | Available | Available   |

The new diagnostic is available only if the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Code Analysis > Enable PX1007 diagnostic** is set to _True_. By default, the value of this option is _False_.

### Ability to Suppress a Diagnostic by Adding a Code Comment
In Acuminator 2.1, you can suppress any diagnostic by adding a specific comment directly in code. To add a suppression comment, you select **Suppress the PXYYYY diagnostic with Acuminator > in a comment** (where PXYYYY is the code of the diagnostic) as a code fix for the diagnostic, as shown in the following screenshot.

![Suppression in Comment](images/SuppressDiagnosticInComment.png)

The code below shows an example of a suppression comment that has been added by the code fix. A suppression comment includes the following parts:

 - The code of the diagnostic (`PX1007` in the code example below).
 - The name of the diagnostic (`NoXmlCommentForPublicClass` in the following code example), which can give a code reviewer an idea of what the suppressed diagnostic is about.
 - The justification of the suppression, which explains why this diagnostic is suppressed for this code fragment. You type the explanation instead of `[Justification]`.

```C#
// Acuminator disable once PX1007 NoXmlCommentForPublicClass [Justification]
public abstract class PXBaseRedirectException : PXException
{
    ...
}
```

You can also suppress an Acuminator diagnostic in the Acuminator suppression file. This option is now available as a code fix and has been removed from the menu commands. The suppression of a diagnostic in the Acuminator suppression file is available only if Acuminator is installed from the VSIX package.

For details about the diagnostic suppression, see [Diagnostic Suppression](diagnostics/DiagnosticSuppression.md).

### Enhancements and Bug Fixes in the Code Map
In Acuminator 2.1, the code map is no longer an experimental feature and includes the following enhancements:

 - The code map now can be used for DACs and DAC extensions. For each DAC, the list of key fields and the full list of DAC fields is displayed. For each DAC field, the code map shows the list of attributes. The code map for a file that contains two DACs is shown in the following screenshot.

 ![Code Map](images/CodeMapForDacs.png)

 - The code map now supports cycling navigation between partial definitions of graphs.
 - The code map UI has been updated with the new icon set.

 The following bugs have been fixed:

 - The code map could freeze for a graph that included a method with a signature similar to that of an event handler.
 - The code map could not display generic event handlers if they had custom names.
 - The code map did not support `CacheAttached` generic event handlers.

### Other Enhancements and Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following enhancements and bug fixes are available:

 - All diagnostics related to DACs now work faster because these diagnostics share the collected semantic information.
 - The [PX1002](diagnostics/PX1002.md) diagnostic now supports DAC extensions. 
 - Null reference issues have been fixed in the BQL formatter and the diagnostics related to fluent BQL.
 - The [PX1004](diagnostics/PX1004.md) and [PX1006](diagnostics/PX1006.md) diagnostics were incorrectly displayed for code based on Acumatica Framework 2018 R2 or later.
 - The [PX1029](diagnostics/PX1029.md) diagnostic was incorrectly displayed for DAC extensions that extended the DACs declared as nested types inside graphs.
 - The [PX1024](diagnostics/PX1024.md) diagnostic did not work for `new` abstract class fields of derived DACs.
 - The [PX1030](diagnostics/PX1030.md) diagnostic was incorrectly displayed for the DACs that contain only unbound fields.
 - The [PX1055](diagnostics/PX1055.md) diagnostic worked incorrectly if the key fields were defined both in the base DAC and in the derived DAC.
 - The BQL outlining worked incorrectly for unary BQL functions, such as `RTrim`.
 - The suppression mechanism did not reload the suppression file when you change the solution in Visual Studio.
 - In some cases, it was not possible to suppress an Acuminator diagnostic in the Acuminator suppression file for a code fragment. The following error was displayed: _There are no Acuminator diagnostics in this code snippet_.
 - The new suppression file was added to the project with the _None_ build action (instead of the _AdditionalFiles_ build action).
 - There was inconsistency in code of the suppression manager related to the use of the project name and the assembly name.

## Acuminator 2.0
Acuminator 2.0 includes the bug fixes and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Key Changes
Acuminator 2.0 includes the following key changes:

 - Acuminator no longer supports Visual Studio 2015. With drop of support of Visual Studio 2015, Acuminator has been moved to Roslyn 2.0 and new Visual Studio SDK methods. These changes improve UX and UI response time and the Acuminator load time.
 - Acuminator now supports C# 7.3.

### Enhancements to Suppression Mechanism
With the new version of Acuminator, you can suppress a particular diagnostic in a specific place in your project as follows:

 1. Click the code that is highlighted by the Acuminator diagnostic so that the editor cursor is in the highlighted element.
 2. Click **Suppress Acuminator Diagnostic > in Acuminator Suppression File** in the context menu or on the **Acuminator** main menu of Visual Studio.

The suppressed diagnostic is saved in the Acuminator suppression file, which is located in the folder of your Visual Studio project. This file has the same name as the project file and the `acuminator` extension. If there is no Acuminator suppression file in the project folder, the file is created automatically.

Acuminator suppression mechanism differs from the standard suppression mechanism of Visual Studio. With the Acuminator suppression mechanism, you can suppress a particular diagnostic in a specific place in the project, while the standard mechanism suppresses all diagnostics with this ID in the type or its member.

To stop suppression of the diagnostic in the particular place in the code, you remove the diagnostic from the Acuminator suppression file manually.

### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:

 - If the Acuminator suppression file had an incorrect XML format, syntax highlighting and other functions stopped working.
 - The [PX1015](diagnostics/PX1015.md) diagnostic was displayed for `PXSelectExtension.Select` methods. Now the diagnostic is not performed on these methods.
 - The [PX1048](diagnostics/PX1048.md) diagnostic was displayed if the code contained the `is` pattern. In Acuminator 2.0, the version of Roslyn that is used internally has been updated to 2.0, which supports the `is` pattern.
 - The analyzer for the [PX1030](diagnostics/PX1030.md) diagnostic failed with an error on some solutions.

### Other Enhancements
Acuminator 2.0 also includes the following enhancements:

 - The code map stays open when the Visual Studio solution is closed.
 - If the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Code Analysis > Enable additional diagnostics for ISV Solution Certification** is _False_, the following diagnostics can now display warnings instead of errors: [PX1027](diagnostics/PX1027.md), [PX1043](diagnostics/PX1043.md), [PX1045](diagnostics/PX1045.md), [PX1047](diagnostics/PX1047.md), [PX1057](diagnostics/PX1057.md), [PX1071](diagnostics/PX1071.md), [PX1073](diagnostics/PX1073.md), and [PX1075](diagnostics/PX1075.md).

## Acuminator 1.6.2
Acuminator 1.6.2 includes the bug fixes described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:

 - The PX1005 diagnostic (for typos in the names of view delegates) displayed warnings for action handlers.
 - Acuminator diagnostics incorrectly worked for `PeriodIDAttribute` and descending classes (such as `FinPeriodAttribute`) and `AcctSubAttribute` and descending classes.
 - Acuminator NuGet package generated warnings about Acumatica-related dependencies.
 - In the code map, the graph events were collected incorrectly: The generic and non-generic events were not grouped together; the hierarchy of graph extensions was created incorrectly.
 - In some cases, because Roslyn had incorrectly determined the effective set of interfaces for the generic type parameter, the code map did not display generic events.

## Acuminator 1.6.1
Acuminator 1.6.1 includes the diagnostics, code fixes, and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### New Diagnostics and Code Fixes
In this version, the diagnostic and a code fix have been added for the following issue.

| Code                            | Issue Description                                                                                           | Type    | Diagnostics | Code Fix    | 
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [PX1013](diagnostics/PX1013.md) | The action handler that initiates a background operation or is executed by a background operation must return `IEnumerable`. | Error | Available   | Available   |

### Enhancements and Bug Fixes in the Code Map
Acuminator 1.6.1 includes the following enhancements in the code map:

 - In the text editor of Visual Studio, the symbol to which the code map navigates is now highlighted.
 - The tooltip for a data view in the code map now keeps the BQL formatting of the source code.
 - The namespace prefixes have been removed from the tooltips in the code map.
 - The categories without child nodes are no longer displayed in the code map.
 - The code map now displays the methods of the base graph that have been overridden through the `PXOverride` attribute.
 - The performance of the code map has been improved.

 The following bugs have been fixed:

 - The code map didn't support graphs with complex declarations.
 - The code map could crash due to an unhandled exception from Roslyn.
 - The code map performed calculations in hidden mode.

### Code Analysis Enhancements
Acuminator now includes the following new options:

 - An option to turn off Acuminator static analysis. If you set the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Code Analysis > Enable code analysis** to _False_, Acuminator diagnostics are not displayed.
 - An option to turn off the suppression mechanism for the Acuminator diagnostics. If you set the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Code Analysis > Suppress selected diagnostics** to _False_, Acuminator ignores the suppression file and displays all diagnostics it has found. This option is intended for internal use in Acumatica.

### Other Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:

 - The PX1018 error was displayed for data views defined in the fluent BQL style.
 - Fluent BQL joins were not supported by the Acuminator colorizer.
 - Acuminator didn't recognize graphs if they were used as generic type parameters. <br/>**Fix description**: Graphs as generic type parameters are now supported. Multiple diagnostics (such as PX1000, PX1001, PX1003, and PX1005) have been refactored. 

### Other Enhancements
Acuminator 1.6.1 also includes the following enhancements:

 - Acuminator now supports Visual Studio 2019. 
 - The PX1005 diagnostic now supports graph extensions.

## Acuminator 1.6
Acuminator 1.6 includes the diagnostics, code fixes, and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### New Diagnostics and Code Fixes
In this version, diagnostics and code fixes for the following issues have been added.

| Code                            | Issue Description                                                                                           | Type    | Diagnostics | Code Fix    |

### Code Map
In this version, you can view the structure of a graph and navigate between the graph members by using the code map. The code map, which is shown in the following screenshot, displays the tree of data views and their delegates, actions and action handlers, and row and field events. Row events are grouped by the DACs to which they are related, and field events are grouped by the DACs and DAC fields. 

![Code Map](images/CodeMap.png)

By clicking the nodes of the tree, you can navigate between the members in the code of the graph. You can also double-click the **Views** or **Actions** node, or a node for a DAC in event nodes to navigate between the graph members of this node. You can use the code map for navigation in code during debugging.

The tooltips for the nodes display the following information:

 - For the data view and action nodes, the full declarations of the data views and actions
 - For the field nodes in the **Cache Attached** node, the attributes declared on the `CacheAttached` events
 - For the attribute nodes in the **Cache Attached** node, the full declaration of each attribute

If you switch between the files, the code map is updated automatically. You can also refresh the code map by clicking the **Refresh Code Map** button on the toolbar of the dialog box.

The code map is an experimental feature, with improvements planned in the coming versions. To open the code map for a graph, click **Code Map (Experimental)** on the **Acuminator** main menu of Visual Studio.

### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:

 - The PX1030 diagnostic worked incorrectly with customizations of `PXDefault` on original DAC fields. Now the diagnostic can display either an error or a warning. For details, see the description of the diagnostic in [PX1030](diagnostics/PX1030.md).
 - Graph-related diagnostics could fail with the _Value cannot be null_ error in some solutions.
 - The recursive diagnostics could enter an endless loop in some solutions.
 - The use of `PXView.Select` in `FieldSelecting` caused the PX1045 error.
 - The PX1088 warning could be displayed for non-processing graphs.

### Other Enhancements
Acuminator 1.6 also includes the following minor enhancements:

 - By invoking the **Go To Action/View Declaration/Handler** action in the context menu or on the **Acuminator** main menu, you can now navigate in code during debugging.
 - The [PX1004](diagnostics/PX1004.md) and [PX1006](diagnostics/PX1006.md) diagnostics have been reimplemented. The diagnostics now support graphs and graph extensions. The diagnostics work with the code based on Acumatica Framework 2018 R1 or earlier.
 - More details have been added to the description of the [PX1014](diagnostics/PX1014.md) diagnostic.

## Acuminator 1.5
Acuminator 1.5 includes the diagnostics, code fixes, and enhancements described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### New Diagnostics and Code Fixes

### Special Diagnostics for ISV Solutions
Now Acuminator includes diagnostics that are designed specifically for the certification of ISV solutions developed based on the Acumatica platform. Developers of ISV solutions have to turn on these diagnostics and fix the issues reported by the diagnostics. For non-ISV solutions, these diagnostics are informational. 

To turn on these diagnostics, you set the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Code Analysis > Enable additional diagnostics for ISV Solution Certification** to _True_. By default, these diagnostics are turned off.

### Enhanced Code Navigation
With the **Go To Action/View Declaration/Handler** in the context menu or on the **Acuminator** main menu, you can now navigate from an action handler in a graph extension to the action declaration in the base graph, and from a data view delegate in a graph extension to the data view declaration in the base graph.

### Fixed Bugs
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed:

 - BQL colorizer of Version 1.4 didn't work in Visual Studio 2015.
 - The PX1012 diagnostic incorrectly determined the primary DAC.
 - Links to diagnostic descriptions in Visual Studio were broken.

## Acuminator 1.4
Acuminator 1.4 includes the diagnostics and code fixes, suggestions for refactoring code, and bug fixes described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in previous versions.

### New Diagnostics and Code Fixes
In this version, diagnostics and code fixes for the following issues have been added.

| Code   | Issue Description                                               | Type    | Diagnostics | Code Fix  | 
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | --------- | 
| [PX1030](diagnostics/PX1030.md) | The `PXDefault` attribute of the field is used incorrectly. `PXDefaultAttribute` used on a custom field defined in `PXCacheExtension` can potentially prevent updates to existing records when it is used without the `PersistingCheck` property set to `Nothing`. | Warning | Available | Available |
| [PX1042](diagnostics/PX1042.md) | In a `RowSelecting` handler, BQL statements and other database queries must be executed only inside a separate connection scope. | Error | Available | Available |
| [PX1043](diagnostics/PX1043.md) | Only the methods of the `PXCache.Persist` family can be used to save changes to the database from `RowPersisting` event handlers. Changes cannot be saved to the database from other event handlers.  | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1044](diagnostics/PX1044.md) | Changes to `PXCache` cannot be performed in event handlers. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1045](diagnostics/PX1045.md) | `PXGraph` instances cannot be created in event handlers. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1046](diagnostics/PX1046.md) | Long-running operations cannot be started within event handlers. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1050](diagnostics/PX1050.md) | Hardcoded strings cannot be used as parameters for localization methods and `PXException` constructors. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1051](diagnostics/PX1051.md) | The strings defined in a class without the `PXLocalizable` attribute cannot be used as parameters for localization methods and `PXException` constructors. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1052](diagnostics/PX1052.md) | The strings without formatted string arguments cannot be used in the methods of the `LocalizeFormat` family. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1053](diagnostics/PX1053.md) | Concatenated strings cannot be used as parameters for localization methods and `PXException` constructors. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1054](diagnostics/PX1054.md) | A `PXGraph` instance must not start a long-running operation during the `PXGraph` initialization. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1057](diagnostics/PX1057.md) | A `PXGraph` instance cannot be initialized while another `PXGraph` instance is being initialized. | Error | Available | Unavailable |
| [PX1058](diagnostics/PX1058.md) | A `PXGraph` instance must not save changes to the database during the `PXGraph` initialization. | Error | Available | Unavailable |

### New Suggestions for Refactoring Code
Acuminator 1.4 suggests one type of code refactoring: replacement of the standard event handler signature with the generic signature. Because an event handler can be overridden in derived classes or graph extensions, after you have applied this refactoring to your code, you have to manually update all possible overrides. 

### Code Analysis Enhancements
Now Acuminator can analyze the code recursively (that is, it can analyze the whole tree of method invocations in a recursive manner). For example, for the PX1042 diagnostic, the code of a `RowSelecting` event handler can contain no direct requests to the database but can contain a call to another method that performs a request to the database. Acuminator 1.4 can find this indirect request to the database.
By default, Acuminator analyzes the code recursively. You can turn off this behavior by setting to _False_ the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Code Analysis > Enable recursive code analysis**.

### Bug Fixes
In this version of Acuminator, the following bugs have been fixed.

| Bug | Fix Description |
| --- | --------------- |
| The PX1021 error was displayed for the DAC fields of the `string[]` type that had an attribute inherited from `PXDBAttributeAttribute`. | The error is not displayed for these fields. |
| The PX1021 error was displayed for the DAC property fields with non-nullable types along with the PX1014 error. | Only the PX1014 error is displayed for the DAC property fields with non-nullable types. |
| The PX1021 and PX1023 errors were displayed if a DAC field had the `PXDBCalced` or `PXDBScalar` attribute. | The PX1021 error is not displayed for the `PXDBCalced` and `PXDBScalar` attributes. The PX1023 diagnostic now finds invalid attributes (type attributes, `PXDBCalced` and `PXDBScalar` attributes) that are used with attributes derived from `PXAggregateAttribute`. The PX1023 diagnostic also finds multiple `PXDBCalced` and `PXDBScalar` attributes on a DAC field. |
| The PX1029 error was displayed for DACs with the `PXPrimaryGraph` attribute. | The use of `PXGraph` instances in DAC attributes is ignored. `PXGraph` instances can be used in `typeof` expressions. |
| The PX1029 diagnostic could be displayed twice for the same code. | Duplicate analysis of DACs has been removed. |
| The PX1029, PX1031, and PX1032 diagnostics displayed errors for custom attributes and helpers declared in DACs. | The PX1029, PX1031, and PX1032 diagnostics do not check the nested DAC classes that had a type other than IBqlField. |
| The PX1032 error was displayed for invocations of methods declared on the system types, such as `string`, `int`, `DateTime`, `Guid`, and `TimeSpan`. | Invocations of methods declared on the system types are skipped by the PX1032 diagnostic. |
| Code navigation didn't support action handlers with no parameters and the `void` return type. | Action handlers with no parameters and the `void` return type are now supported by code navigation. |

### Other Enhancements
Acuminator now includes detailed descriptions of the diagnostics. You can open the description by clicking the link in the diagnostic message.

## Acuminator 1.3
Acuminator 1.3 includes the diagnostics and code fixes, enhancements, and bug fixes described in this section, as well as the features that have been implemented in the previous versions.

| [PX1040](diagnostics/PX1040.md) | Constructors cannot be used in BLC extensions.                  | Error   | Available   | Available | 

### New Code Navigation
Acuminator now can navigate between an action and its handler, and between a data view declaration and its delegate. To navigate between these items, do the following:
1. Click on an action, an action handler, a data view declaration, or a data view delegate.
2. Click **Go To Action/View Declaration/Handler** in the context menu or on the **Acuminator** main menu.

### BQL Formatting Enhancements
In previous versions of Acuminator, you had to manually add the **Format BQL Statements** command to the context menu of the code editor in Visual Studio. In Acuminator 1.3, this command is available in the context menu by default. Also this command is now available on the **Acuminator** main menu. 

### Code Outlining Enhancements
* Now you can configure Acuminator to outline entire BQL statements. To do this in Visual Studio, set to _False_ the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > BQL Outlining > Outline parts of BQL commands**.
* The **Use BQL outlining** has been moved under **Tools > Options > Acuminator > BQL Outlining**.

### Code Coloring Enhancements
* All code coloring options have been grouped under **Tools > Options > Acuminator > BQL Coloring**.
* Acuminator now colors angle brackets of any level. For coloring, Acuminator cycles through 14 colors.
* Acuminator now colors type parameters if they represent DACs, graphs, or other types that are colored by Acuminator.

### Other Enhancements
* Static code analyzers from Acuminator are now available as a [standalone NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Acuminator.Analyzers/).
* The PX.Objects.HackathonDemo demo solution has been refactored: The files of the solution have been grouped by the diagnostics they illustrate and placed in folders with sensible names.

### Bug Fixes
In this version, the following bugs have been fixed.

| Bug | Fix Description |
| --- | --------------- |
| The PX1000 diagnostic worked only on graphs. | The PX1000 diagnostic now also works on graph extensions. |
| The PX1004 and PX1006 diagnostics threw the `InvalidCastException` exception in some cases. | The cast expression in the diagnostic now takes into account the type parameters in the graph views. |
| The PX1008 diagnostic threw the `NullReferenceException` exception in some cases. | The PX1008 diagnostic now supports the case when a method group from a helper class is passed to `SetProcessingDelegate`. Null checks have been added. |
| The code fix of the PX1010 diagnostic didn't work for delegates with iterator methods, multiple return statements, and `goto` statements. | The PX1010 diagnostic now supports iterator methods, multiple return statements, and `goto` statements. |
| The PX1010 diagnostic threw an exception for abstract BQL delegate declarations. | The PX1010 diagnostic now checks whether the method body exists. |
| Simple BQL statements, such as `PXSelect<Table>`, were formatted. | Simple BQL statements now are not formatted. |
| The `PXUpdate` BQL statements were not colorized. | Code coloring is now supported for the `PXUpdate` classes. |
| The unbound generic BQL types, such as `Select5<,>`, used in BQL compose scenarios were not colorized. | Code coloring now works for the unbound generic BQL types. |
| Some DACs were not colorized. | The Roslyn SemanticModel has been refreshed. Now all DACs are colorized. |
| Visual Studio showed errors and warnings about a failed resource load in the **Error List**. | The resource file for the Acuminator diagnostics is now generated correctly. |

## Acuminator 1.2.1
Acuminator 1.2.1 contains the hotfix for the critical bug found in Version 1.2 that broke the execution of static code analysis.

## Acuminator 1.2
Acuminator 1.2 includes the new features and the bug fix described in this section, as well as the features for the previous versions, which are described in the Acuminator 1.1 and Acuminator 1.0 sections.
### New Settings for Roslyn Coloring
You can adjust the color settings of Acuminator for Roslyn coloring as follows:
* Colorize PXAction declarations.<br/> In Visual Studio, specify the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Enable PXAction coloring**.      
* Colorize PXGraph declarations.<br/> In Visual Studio, specify the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Enable PXGraph coloring**.                                                      
* Colorize code only inside BQL commands.<br/> In Visual Studio, specify the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Colorize code only inside BQL commands**. 

### Support for Visual Themes in Visual Studio
Acuminator can use different color sets for different visual themes (such as light and dark themes) in Visual Studio.

### Code Outlining
Acuminator can collapse parts of BQL statements and the code inside attributes to small tags. To use code outlining, in Visual Studio, set **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Use BQL outlining** to True.

### Bug Fix
In this version, the following bug has been fixed.

| Bug    | Fix Description                         | 
| ------ | --------------------------------------- | 
| Acuminator 1.1 always used tabs to format BQL statements, regardless of the Visual Studio settings. | Acuminator 1.2 formats BQL statements with spaces or tabs depending on the settings in **Tools > Options > Text Editor > C# > Tabs**.  |
 
## Acuminator 1.1
Acuminator 1.1 provides the new features described in this section as well as the features described below for Acuminator 1.0.
### New Diagnostics and Code Fixes
In this version, diagnostics and a code fix for the following issue have been added.

| Code   | Issue Description                       | Type    | Diagnostics | Code Fix  | 
| ------ | --------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | --------- | 
| [PX1014](diagnostics/PX1014.md) | A DAC field must have a nullable type.  | Error   | Available   | Available | 

### Coloring Based on Regular Expressions
Acuminator can colorize code based on regular expressions or by using Roslyn.  Coloring based on regular expressions works faster but coloring that uses Roslyn (which is used by default) provides more color options. To change the way the code is colored, in Visual Studio, set the value of **Tools > Options > Acuminator > Use RegEx colorizer**.

### BQL Formatting
Acuminator can format all BQL statements in the file that is currently open. To apply formatting, in Visual Studio, click **Edit > Format BQL Statements** on the main menu. You can also add the command to the context menu of the code editor in **Tools > Customize > Commands**. 

## Acuminator 1.0
Acuminator 1.0 introduces the following features.

### Diagnostics and Code Fixes
In the code based on Acumatica Framework, Acuminator finds common mistakes and typos and suggests code fixes. The list of the issues that Acuminator diagnoses is described in the following table.

| Code   | Issue Description                                                                                                                               | Type    | Diagnostics | Code Fix      |
